## About

Welcome to **enigma-python**, a Python package designed to emulate the legendary Enigma cryptographic machine used during World War II. enigma-python provides a faithful implementation of the Enigma machine, allowing users to explore and understand the workings of this historic device.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Configuration**: enigma-python allows customization of the Enigma machine configuration, enabling users to experiment with different rotor settings, reflectors, and ring positions.
- **Easy Extension**: enigma-python is designed to be easily extensible, allowing developers to add new features or enhance the existing implementation.
- **Simple yet faithful**: don't be fooled by its simplicity; enigma-python implements 100% the algorithms of many Enigma machine models, allowing to decode a message that has been encoded by a real Enigma machine and also the contrary.
